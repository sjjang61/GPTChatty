Naver and Kakao, which have been actively recruiting workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, are cutting back on hiring. NAVER, which conducted large-scale recruitment in the first half of the year, will not hold open recruitment (public hiring) in the second half of the year. It is unclear whether Kakao will hold recruitment in the second half of the year.

NAVER, which conducted triple-digit public offerings in the first half of the year... No plans for the second half of the year
<br><br>
According to the industry on the 22nd, NAVER is not expected to hold public recruitment in the second half of this year. A NAVER representative said, "There is no schedule for the second half of the year, and we will conduct recruitment by affiliates as needed."

NAVER previously held a recruitment drive in the first half of this year with affiliates such as NAVER Cloud. The size of the recruitment was in the triple digits.

NAVER has been actively recruiting talent in the past few years due to the growing demand for online (non-face-to-face) services during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, the company announced plans to hire 900 developers and continued to hire in triple digits in the second half of the year.
<br><br>  
However, in 2022, due to the pandemic, NAVER reduced the number of new hires from twice a year in the first half to once a year in the second half. In the first quarter of 2022, labor costs were cited as a reason for the slowdown in growth, with results falling short of market expectations.
<br><br>
The reduction in hiring in the second half of the year is in response to NAVER's sense of crisis. Analysts expect that cost control, including labor costs, will be evident in the second quarter results. According to the consensus, NAVER is expected to report revenue of 2.4 trillion won ($1.4 billion) and operating income of 367.4 billion won. This is a year-on-year increase of about 18% in revenue and 9% in operating profit.
